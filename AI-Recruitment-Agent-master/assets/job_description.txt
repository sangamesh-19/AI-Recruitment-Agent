Job Summary:
We are seeking a highly skilled Assembly Developer to join our team. The ideal candidate will have expertise in low-level programming, performance optimization, and reverse engineering. You will be responsible for writing, debugging, and maintaining Assembly code, working closely with hardware and software teams to develop high-performance applications and embedded systems.

Key Responsibilities:
Develop, optimize, and maintain software in Assembly (x86, x86_64, ARM, RISC-V, or other architectures).
Work with low-level system components, including bootloaders, device drivers, and firmware.
Reverse engineer legacy software to enhance, optimize, or integrate with modern systems.
Debug and profile Assembly code to ensure maximum performance and efficiency.
Collaborate with C/C++ developers to create hybrid solutions where Assembly is required for performance-critical tasks.
Analyze system memory, registers, and CPU pipelines to optimize execution speed.
Work with embedded systems, microcontrollers, or BIOS/UEFI firmware when required.
Develop security-related software, including cryptographic implementations and secure boot systems.
Contribute to performance benchmarking and optimization strategies.
Requirements:
Technical Skills:
Proficiency in Assembly language for at least one major architecture (x86, x86_64, ARM, RISC-V, etc.).
Experience with C and C++ for integrating Assembly code with higher-level applications.
Strong understanding of computer architecture, CPU pipelines, registers, stack management, and calling conventions.
Experience with debugging tools like GDB, WinDbg, or IDA Pro.
Familiarity with operating system internals (Linux, Windows, or embedded OS).
Knowledge of SIMD (SSE, AVX, Neon) and vectorized computing is a plus.
Experience with reverse engineering, binary analysis, and decompilation is a bonus.
Soft Skills:
Strong problem-solving and analytical skills.
Ability to work independently and in a team.
Excellent attention to detail and precision in coding.
Passion for low-level programming and optimization.
Preferred Qualifications:
Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or a related field (or equivalent experience).
Experience with firmware development, real-time operating systems (RTOS), or kernel-level programming.
Prior experience in cybersecurity, malware analysis, or exploit development is a plus.
Contributions to open-source Assembly projects or low-level programming communities.
Experience with Git.
Experience with Docker.
Experience with Java.
Experience with C#.
Experience with Python.
Experience with Assembly.
Experience with C.
Experience with C++.
